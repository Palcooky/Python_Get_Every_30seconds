Not really any info from the client on this project. Only asked to make a request to a website every 30 seconds.

Found this a little basic so added a logging function to log the response code, site and time of the request. 

So features:
- Request to a website every 30 seconds
- Log the response code, site and time of the request
- Rotate Logs at midnight
- Delete any logs older than 7 days
